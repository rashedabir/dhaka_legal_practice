        <p>
          “Dhaka Legal Practice” is a new-generation law firm. Our aim is to
          provide efficient and cost-effective services to our clients whilst
          maintaining highest degree of professional standard and that is why
          the members of the firm maintain a high degree of professional
          approach and due diligence. In “Dhaka Legal Practice” we tend to build
          life-long relationships with our clients by treating our clients with
          respect. This requires us to be selective in the work that we accept
          and for whom we represent. We invest additional time to assess our
          prospective client(s) to find out whether we can provide required
          support or not and we also give detailed and personal attention to the
          facts and documents for which the client approaches us to assess the
          merit of the matter. In terms of client expectation, the firm is
          attuned towards commercially realistic outcomes. Our clients are
          private individuals, public and privately held commercial business,
          financial and allied institutions as well as offshore entities
          involved in sophisticated corporate and financial transactions.
